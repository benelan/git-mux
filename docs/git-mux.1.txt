# NAME

**git-mux** - a git + tmux lovechild for blazingly fast movement between
projects and tasks

# SYNOPSIS

**git mux clone** \<repository\> [\<directory\>]  
**git mux project** [\<directory\>]  
**git mux task** [\<branch\>] [\<window\>]  
**git mux task** \<directory\> [\<window\>] [\<command\>...]  
**git mux help**

# COMMANDS

## clone

Clone and configure a bare **git**(1) \<repository\> for use with worktrees.

Aliases: **c**, **-c**, **--clone**

## project

Create and/or switch to a *project*, which is a **tmux**(1) session. Projects
are also usually a **git**(1) repo, but they can be created for any directory.

Aliases: **p**, **-p**, **--project**

## task

Create, switch, and/or send commands to a *task*, which is a **tmux**(1)
window. Tasks are also usually a **git-worktree**(1) or **git-branch**(1), but
can be created for any directory.

Aliases: **t**, **-t**, **--task**

## help

Open the **git-mux** man page. Use **h** or **-h** to print a concise help
message to **stderr**(3) instead.

Aliases: **--help**

# EXAMPLES

Select a *project*, then create and/or switch to its **tmux**(1) session.
Selects with **fzf**(1) by default, but the command can be changed using
**\$GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD**. See the *ENVIRONMENT* section.

```sh
git mux p
```

Directly create and/or switch to a *project* (useful for a keymap or alias).

```sh
git mux project ~/projects/my-app
```

Create and/or switch to a **tmux**(1) \<window\> named "123" via
**basename**(1). If "feature/123" is a valid \<directory\>, the window will be
opened at that location. Otherwise, assume it is a **git**(1) \<branch\> name.
Create and/or switch to the **git-worktree**(1) if the _project_ is a bare
repo, otherwise create and/or checkout the **git-branch**(1).

```sh
git mux task feature/123
```

Select an existing **git-branch**(1) for the *task*.

```sh
git mux t
```

Install dependencies and run tests in a **tmux**(1) \<window\> named
"test_client" without switching to it. Specifying the \<window\> name is
required when sending commands.

```sh
git mux task packages/client test_client npm i && npm test
```

# ENVIRONMENT

**git-mux** can be configured with the following environment variables.
Specifying the *project* directories with either **\$GIT_MUX_PROJECTS** or
**\$GIT_MUX_PROJECT_PARENTS** is required, and setting both will combine their
values. All other configuration is optional.

## GIT_MUX_PROJECTS

Space delimited list of individual *project* directories for selection. The
paths must be absolute or start with "~" and cannot contain spaces.

```sh
export GIT_MUX_PROJECTS="~/notes ~/.config/nvim"
```

## GIT_MUX_PROJECT_PARENTS

Space delimited list of directories that contain projects, defaults to
**\$PROJECTS** if set. The immediate child directories (depth=1) of each parent
are used for selection. The paths must be absolute or start with "~" and cannot
contain spaces.

```sh
export GIT_MUX_PROJECT_PARENTS="~/dev/work ~/dev/personal"
```

In the **\$GIT_MUX_PROJECTS** and **\$GIT_MUX_PROJECT_PARENTS** examples above,
the resulting *project* list used for selection would be:

```text
~/notes
~/.config/nvim
~/work/acme-cli
~/work/acme-site
~/personal/my-brilliant-app-ideas
~/personal/my-failed-startup
```

Assuming the following file structure:

```text
~/
├─ .config/
│  ├─ nvim/
│  │  ├─ lua/
│  │  ├─ init.lua
├─ notes/
│  ├─ how_to_quit_neovim.md
│  ├─ ada_lawsuit_summary.doc
├─ personal/
│  ├─ my-brilliant-app-ideas/
│  ├─ my-failed-startup/
│  │  ├─ whats_a11y.html
├─ work/
│  ├─ acme-cli/
│  │  ├─ download_more_ram.js
│  ├─ acme-site/
│  │  ├─ src/
│  │  │  ├─ spaghetti.jsx
```

## GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD

Command used to select a *project* or *task*. Defaults to **fzf**(1). This can
be any command that receives the directory list from **stdin**(3) and prints a
single, selected directory to **stdout**(3).

For example, create the following script somewhere on your **\$PATH** (e.g.,
*~/.local/bin/\_git-mux-select*), to use **dialog**(1) for selection:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
stdin=$(cat)
dialog --no-items --erase-on-exit --menu "GIT MUX" 0 0 0 $stdin 2>&1 >/dev/tty
```

Then add the following to your shell startup scripts (e.g., *\~/.bashrc*):

```sh
export GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD="_git-mux-select"
```

## GIT_MUX_BRANCH_PREFIX

A \<prefix\> string to prepend to the name of new branches created via the
*task* command. When set, the resulting **git-branch**(1) name is
"\<prefix\>/\<branch\>". This option is ignored if the \<branch\> name provided
to *task* already contains a "/".

For example, the following would create a **git-branch**(1) named
"JohnDoe/fix-123" if your GitHub username (system user as backup) is "JohnDoe":

```sh
export GIT_MUX_BRANCH_PREFIX="$(git config --global github.user || id -un)"
git mux task fix-123
```

## GIT_MUX_NEW_WORKTREE_CMD

Command(s) to execute in the **tmux**(1) window when a new **git-worktree**(1)
is created via the *task* command. Unset by default. You can assume that
**\$PWD** is the root directory of the new worktree.

For example, to install Node.js dependencies in new worktrees (when relevant):

```sh
export GIT_MUX_NEW_WORKTREE_CMD='[ -f "./package.json" ] && npm i'
```

Creating a script somewhere on your **\$PATH** for more complicated commands is
recommended. See **\$GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD** above for an example.

## GIT_MUX_NEW_SESSION_CMD

Command(s) to execute when a new **tmux**(1) session is created via the
**project** command. Unset by default. You can assume that **\$PWD** is the
root directory of the specified project.

For example, to rename the **tmux**(1) window to "scratch":

```sh
export GIT_MUX_NEW_SESSION_CMD='tmux rename-window scratch'
```

Creating a script somewhere on your **\$PATH** for more complicated commands is
recommended. See **\$GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD** above for an example.

## GIT_MUX_LOGS

A path to the log file. Logs are disabled if set to "0" or unset, which is the
default. If set to "1", the logs are saved to
*\${XDG_STATE_HOME:-\$HOME/.local/state}/git-mux/logs*.

## GIT_MUX_LOG_LEVEL

The minimum level of log entries to save, defaults to all levels if logging is
enabled via **\$GIT_MUX_LOGS**. The log levels are:

*DEBUG* < *INFO* < *WARN* < *ERROR*

For example, to save log entries with *ERROR* and *WARN* levels:

```sh
export GIT_MUX_LOG_LEVEL="WARN"
```

# BUGS

The following are known limitations of **git-mux**:

- Project paths cannot contain spaces.

Try these troubleshooting tips if you are experiencing issues:

- Run **git mux config** to print the current config values and make sure
  they're what you expect.

- Enable logs using the **\$GIT_MUX_LOGS** config option and rerun the command
  that caused issues. See the *ENVIRONMENT* section for more info.

If none of the troubleshooting steps helped resolve the issue, please submit an
issue on GitHub:

# COMPATIBILITY

The following external tools are used by **git-mux**:

- **tmux**(1) - Required.

- **git**(1)  - Required by the *task* command if the next argument is not a
  valid directory. Also required to execute the script as **git mux** versus
  **git-mux**.

- **fzf**(1)  - Required by default, but can be changed using the
  **\$GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD** configuration option. See the *ENVIRONMENT* section.

**git-mux** should be POSIX compliant (other than the non-standard utilities
listed above), meaning it will likely work on your system. Unless you're using
Windows without WSL, in which case I don't know how you ended up reading this
documentation in the first place.

Please log an issue if you experience any compatibility issues on a Unix
machine.
